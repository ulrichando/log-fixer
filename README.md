# 🔍 LogFixer - Intelligent Log Analyzer & Issue Tracker

**LogFixer** is a powerful Python-based script that automatically detects anomalies, errors, and potential issues in log files. Once an issue is identified, it can be saved to a local or remote database for future reference, audits, and proactive system maintenance.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Automatic log scanning and parsing
- ✅ Intelligent issue detection (e.g., `ERROR`, `FATAL`, `Connection refused`, etc.)
- ✅ Customizable pattern matching
- ✅ Saves issues to a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Clean and human-readable output
- ✅ CLI or API-based integration

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Input**: Provide one or multiple log files (e.g., `/var/log/syslog`).
2. **Scan**: Script reads and parses the logs line by line.
3. **Detect**: Uses rule-based or regex-based scanning to find common errors, warnings, or security threats.
4. **Store**: Saves detected issues in a structured database for analytics or audits.
